# fomite_model_comparison

This code is for the manuscript, "Comparing approaches for modelling indirect contact transmission of infectious diseases," by Amanda M. Wilson, Mark H. Weir, Marco-Felipe King, and Rachael M. Jones. It has been submitted to the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

The file, "main_code.R" should be run first. This will produce results for the primary Markov and discrete event models. Next, "Sensitivity analysis.R" should be run, which will produce other figures in the manuscript and values for the Spearman correlation coefficient table. Next, "sensitivity_analysis_v2.R" should be run, which will produce results for the second part of the sensitivity analysis described in the manuscript. Other files in the repository are sourced within the previously described files or were used for examples/checks during code development.
